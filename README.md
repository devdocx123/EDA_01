## 📅 Day 1 – Data Cleaning & Exploration (IPL Auction Dataset)

**Objective:**  
Kickstart the EDA process by exploring and cleaning the **IPL Auction dataset**, understanding player distribution, and preparing the data for analysis.

**Key Steps:**
- Loaded and explored the raw dataset.
- Handled missing and inconsistent values.
- Detected and removed outliers.
- Performed basic feature engineering.
- Visualized trends like retained, sold, and unsold players using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

**Files:**
- `Day01/EDA01.ipynb`
- `Day01/iplauction2023_raw-data.csv`
- `Day01/iplauction2023_cleaned-data.csv`

**Outcome:**  
Prepared a clean dataset highlighting player trends and financial insights for further analysis.

## ⚙️ Day 2 – Feature Engineering on Water Potability Dataset 💧

**Objective:**  
Apply **Feature Engineering** and **Data Transformation** techniques on a new dataset — *Water Potability* — to practice handling numerical data and improving data quality for model training.

**Key Steps:**
- Explored relationships between chemical properties (pH, hardness, solids, etc.).
- Handled missing values and treated outliers.
- Scaled and normalized features to bring uniformity.
- Conducted correlation analysis using heatmaps.
- Prepared the dataset for classification model readiness.

**Files:**
- `Day02/EDA02.ipynb`
- `Day02/water_potability_ds2.csv` ( raw dataset)
- `Day02/cleaned_dataset_Water-Potability.csv` (cleaned dataset)

**Outcome:**  
Achieved a balanced, preprocessed dataset with key insights into water quality indicators — ready for ML model implementation.
