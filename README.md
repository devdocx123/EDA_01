# 🧠 Day 09 – Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This notebook covers the basics of **Support Vector Machines** using the **Iris dataset**.

## 🔍 What is SVM?
SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the best boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes with the **maximum margin**.

## 💡 Why We Use It
- Works well for both linear and non-linear data  
- Uses kernels to handle complex patterns  
- Robust and performs well on small to medium datasets  

## ⭐ Key Aspects
- Support Vectors  
- Maximum Margin  
- Kernel Trick (linear, RBF, polynomial)  

## 📘 What I Did
- Loaded the **Iris dataset**
- Split into train/test sets  
- Trained SVM models with different kernels  
- Checked accuracy  
- Added a few visualizations of predictions and boundaries
